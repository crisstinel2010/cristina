## Dripping Technique

I am not the first one to use enamel as a painting technique. Jackson Pollock was the first in the history of arts to use particular enamels and acrylic colours. His technique is called dripping and it is considered the most important example of gestural painting called “action painting”.
With the canvas on the floor, horizontally, dripping the colours, Jackson Pollock used to create abstract paintings with a unique chromatic sensibility. The difference between him and me, although we use the same technique, is that I personalized it and took it to the figurative sphere: portraits, landscapes, dead nature and many others. I love these colours because, from a technical point of view, a true alchemy is created.
Every single colour has its own personality: one needs a nitro thinner, another one wants the synthetic, and another one requires water or white-water and so on. If I would put a colour on another and the thinners were not compatible, the colours would eat each other and ruin my painting.
The same thing would happen if I would not know how to measure out the thinner. I feel like a lion tamer with these colours. I ruined several paintings until I understood the character of every colour in order to domesticate them.

## More about Cristina Lefter

Born in Moldavia on the 27th of April 1976 under the Russian communist regime. Lefter began painting at the tender age of 5. At age 10 she attended a private art school and soon afterwards Lefter moved with her family to Bucharest Romania where she eventually acquired Romanian citizenship. She began an intensive study of art by enrolling at the Artistic Lyceum of Iasi in Romania and successfully being accepted into the Fine Arts Academy of Iasi. Lefter’s art school preparation formed a solid academic base. Her artistic values are instilled with a constant research for beauty, harmony, synergy and balance. Lefter passionately reflects on the idea of past and future as a means of comparison and contrast giving way to a spiritual interaction of respect for these intangible concepts. Painting and creating have always been gestures of liberation from the past while endorsing the future based on renewal as a possibility to instinctively reveal herself to her art public.

In 2000 Lefter became a member of the Union of Artists of Romania. The delima of being brought up in a dictatorial communist state even at the onset of the new millenium, put Lefter in contrast with decades of a mindset that didn’t fully comprehend the concept of complete individual artistic freedom and pluralism which Lefter so truly cherishes. In 2002 at the age of 25 she moved to Italy and chose the region of Veneto and used the occasion to settle in Padova where she felt a sentimental yearning to explore her Italian heritage. The overwhelming cultural patrimony of the Venetian region and Italy as a whole is a continual and inexhaustible source of inspiration for the artist. Cristina Lefter arrived in Milan in 2008 where she uses the capital of Lombardy as her home and artistic base and is a part of the city’s cultural community.

Coloured enamels are highly preferred by Lefter because they represent a creative being while seemingly possessing a stand out chemical personality. Lefter is able to deftly control, mix and dominate various colours in an extremely convincing manner.
The “dripping” process of Jackson Pollock’s abstract expressionism is interpreted in Cristina Lefter’s work as figurative “dripping”. The enamels that she uses, at first, drip slowly on the canvas in such an undefined way that they seem incomprehensible while in the meantime the materials take form and life in a spontaneous and continual mutation.

The canvas is horizontal and with a canister of colour in hand Lefter goes on the offensive. The artist is ready for ”action painting” that of the New York School in which Jackson Pollock was the master. This painting style free of any scheme, form or pre described model, immediate in its execution and spontaneous in its realisation yet manifesting forms of the human body. Colours can be laid out on the canvas in an exaggerated and disproportioned brush stroke movement or naively splashed or contrastingly laid on violently. This style of painting demands that the canvas is positioned horizontally whereas a vertical position can imply dynamism and movement. The implicit mood of caos is also perceived in her colour selections.

The incessant dribbling of colour crystallize into form while expressing Lefter’s spirit. The abstract expressionist drippings so representative of Jackson Pollock and the physicality of his “action painting” is a key component of the DNA of Cristina Lefter whose body gestures towards her canvases are actively instinctive but hardly casual. The results of this artistic passion demonstrates how her canvases are materially unique. Lefter’s color compositions reveal dazzling displays of perspective in landscapes, forests and metropolitan skylines.
Cristina Lefter’s skill, competence and mastery of various painting techniques allows her to chose countless avenues of new artistic projects.
